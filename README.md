# Zappi-Brand-Loyalty-Analysis
A Data Analysis Project Using Excel, MySQL, Power BI


## Project Overview
This project explores customer sentiment and brand loyalty using data from a fictional survey dataset modeled after Zappi's brand insight processes. The goal was to identify patterns in customer loyalty, ad recall, and message clarity across demographic groups. This project also served as a personal challenge in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Objectives
- Understand how different age groups and regions interact with brand messaging.
- Evaluate ad performance using A/B testing.
- Explore customer loyalty patterns and the likelihood of customer switching.
- Build a professional Power BI dashboard to present key insights.
- Demonstrate growth in data storytelling and dashboard design.

## Tools & Skills Used
### Tool	Purpose
- Excel	Data cleaning, formatting, and age grouping
- MySQL	Querying, transformation, and data exploration
- Power BI	Visualization, dashboard design
- A/B Testing: Compare ad version effectiveness

## Data Cleaning (Excel)
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and invalid gender values.
- Created an Age_Category column (e.g., "Young Adult", "Older").
- Standardized column formats (scores, NPS values).
- Highlighted and removed blanks using conditional formatting and filters.

## SQL Analysis (MySQL)
- Sample questions answered:
- What is the average NPS score by region?
- Which gender had the highest ad engagement?
- Which ad version performed better?
- Who is most likely to switch brands by age group?

*All queries were written in MySQL, and results were verified before visualization.*

## Power BI Dashboard
Theme: Clean, professional layout with soft, warm colors (moss green, muted orange, off-white). Designed with intermediate-level storytelling principles.

### Key Visuals Included:
- KPI Cards: Avg. NPS, Brand Loyalty Score
- Donut Chart: NPS Category Distribution
- Stacked Bar Chart: Ad Recall vs Engagement
- Area Chart: Switch Likelihood by Age Group
- Composition Tree: Customer Segments
- Feedback Comment Highlights (Word trim substitute)
- Dashboard emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and impactful spacing.

## Key Insights
- Ad Version B performed better in terms of engagement and recall.
- Middle-aged groups (35–54 years old) had higher brand loyalty.
- Customers with high engagement showed lower switching likelihood.
- Feedback highlighted message clarity as a driver of loyalty.

## Analytical Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- A/B Testing on ad versions
- Segmentation by age, gender, and region
- Aggregation & metric comparison
- Data storytelling through Power BI

## What I Learned
- How to design from a research question, not just a dataset.
- Importance of retracing steps during data cleaning when errors arise.
- Applied A/B testing in real data for the first time – and I loved it!
- Gained more confidence in visual design, color theory, and layout.
